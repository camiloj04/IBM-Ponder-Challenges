    "A robot is distributing COVID-19 vaccines on an NxN grid. At the beginning, the robot is located at the (0,0) cell facing UP, and every cell in the grid is marked as having received zero doses of the vaccine. The robot's goal is to ensure that each cell on the grid gets two doses of vaccine by visiting each cell twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the robot was attacked by anti-vaccine bots, causing its navigation system to malfunction. As a result, the robot now acts like this at every step:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the cell was vaccinated 0 times, it administers one dose (raising the cell's status from \"0\" to \"1\") and turns 90 degrees CLOCKWISE.\n",
    "If the cell was vaccinated 1 time, it administers one dose (raising the cell's status from \"1\" to \"2\") and turns 90 degrees COUNTERCLOCKWISE.\n",
    "If the cell was vaccinated 2 times, the robot does not change direction.\n",
    "The robot then takes one step in the direction it is currently facing. If the step takes it out of the grid, it returns from the other side (i.e., coordinate arithmetic is modulo N).\n",
    "Here is an example of how the robot acts on a 4x4 grid for the first few steps (the cell (0,0) is pictured at the top-left corner). The current cell is marked by square brackets; recall that the robot begins by facing upwards.\n",
